   2. Mild Wash (30 minutes - $2.50)
   3. Medium Wash (45 minutes - $4.20)
   4. Heavy Wash (1 hour - $6)

      1. Total time switched on.
      2. Amount of money earned since in service or reset.
   2. Allow reset operation for the statistics for washing machine owner.

You are free to implement the solution in the language of your choice. You can demonstrate the functionality of your code in either a simple graphical UI or on the console.

Design and document the solution, provide a class diagram, and provide the necessary examples or commands to demonstrate that the above requirements are met.

Your code shall be able to handle interactions and show the status of the washing machine at any given point in time (e.g., function to open washing machine door, status of current wash).
